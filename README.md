Greetings to the one who came here to find the explanation to the codes that I,ve mentioned in the repository.
I wrote all these codes seeking the help from chatgpt and by running these on EDA playground. 
I started with the gates, going on with some combinational circuits like adders, mux, decoders etc. 
While writing the DUT for combinational codes, I got to learn the basic DUT data types, vectors, port list syntax, input declarations, blocking statements and tb's were basic tb's, not the self checking tb's
But the real learning started from writing Sequentional circuit DUT starting from latches and flipflops
Because the seq circuits has this thing called clock. so the real part started now
Postitive edge trigered, reset, Synchronous and Asynchronous reset, non blocking statements, posedge clk, reg and wire data type differences in DUT and tb, and so on
It took me a while to learn sequentional circuits and was confusing at the start, but I was holding on to it, finally somehow made it.
It's not that if you give me a problem right now and I solved it right away, but if you give me the idea, I can work on it.
So this isn't done yet, I have to practice more and more until I get good grip on it.
But this all thing is to tell that I started it finally, and this goes on and on and on until I stop.
I'll update my next phase of my work on Github. Thank you.
